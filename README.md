# WASA_Clim-Qobs
For the WASA-SED model: A collection of R-scripts to generate input data. 

Climate timerseries (ClimTS): download NCEP data, reformat, analyse statistics &amp; plot. 

Observed river discharge (Qobs): reformat, analyse statistics/NA &amp; plot. 

Qobs_read_discharge.R can "collect" single discharge text files for each subbasins and combine them in one file "discharge_obs_24.txt", as needed for validation of model results.

Qobs-mod_summary-NAcheck-plots.R is a collection of plotting scripts for observed discharge (Q obs), as well as joint plots with precipitation, Q obs and Q modelled; you can also create continous time series of observation data or only plot for certain time intervals.
